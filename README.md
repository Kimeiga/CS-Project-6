# CS-Project-6

 This project is designed to help you master pointers. To that end, you'll get the most out of it by working through the problems by hand. Only after that should you resort to running the programs (and stepping through them with the debugger) to check your understanding. Remember, on the final exam you'll have to be able to do problems like this by hand.

This "project" is more like a homework. There are five problems. In problems that ask you to change code, make the few changes necessary to fix the code without changing its overall approach.
